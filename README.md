# Asteroids-Clone
An Asteroids clone I made for an assignment at university

<b>Introduction</b>

My game is called Asteroid Hunter for simplicity’s sake. It is a simple game, yet hard to master. 
The core gameplay comes from collecting shield power-ups while avoiding and destroying asteroids. 
The game can be run by using the .jar file included in the submission via the command line (by typing 
in the line “java -jar AsteroidHunter.jar”). If that does not work, you can also run it from Eclipse. 
Controls are also simple: the ‘W’ key is used for thrusting while the ‘A’ and ‘D’ keys are used for turning left and right, respectively. 
‘Spacebar’ is used for shooting.
